  BGP AS_PATH Verification Based on Forwarding Commitment (FC) Objects
                draft-xu-sidrops-fc-verification-latest

Abstract

   The Forwarding Commitment (FC) is an RPKI object that attests to the
   complete routing intents description which an Autonomous System (AS)
   would obey in Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route propagation.  This
   document specifies an FC-based AS Path Verification methodology to
   mitigate, even solve, AS Path forgery and route leaks.  This document
   also explains the various BGP security threats that FC can help
   address and provides operational considerations associated with FC
   deployment.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is vulnerable to route hijacks and
   route leaks [RFC7908].  Some existing BGP extensions can partially
   solve or alleviate these problems.  Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI) based route origin validation (RPKI-ROV)
   [RFC6480] [RFC6811] [RFC9319] [RFC9582] and Signed Prefix List-based
   Route Origin Verification (SPL-ROV)
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-prefixlist] can be used to detect and filter
   accidental mis-originations.  BGPsec is designed to provide security
   for the AS-path attribute in the BGP UPDATE message [RFC8205].
   [RFC9234] and Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA)
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile] aim at detecting and mitigating
   accidental route leaks.

   However, there are still some issues that need to be addressed.  ASPA
   is a genius mechanism to verify BGP AS-path attribute content, which
   only stores customer-to-provider information in RPKI.  Autonomous
   System Relationship Authorization (ASRA) has listed several security
   problems with ASPA in Section 2 of [I-D.geng-sidrops-asra-profile].
   Though the validity of the ASPA/ASRA objects is verified, the
   relationship between two BGP neighbors cannot be attested.  When two
   ASes announce mutually exclusive relationships, for example, AS A
   says AS B is its Provider and AS B says AS A is its Provider, no
   other ASes can verify their real relationships.

   The Forwarding Commitment (FC) [I-D.guo-sidrops-fc-profile] is a
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) object that attests to the
   complete routing intents description an Autonomous System (AS) would
   obey in Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route propagation.

   This document specifies an FC-based AS Path Verification methodology
   to prevent AS path forgery in the BGP AS-path attribute of advertised
   routes.  FC-based AS_PATH verification also detects and mitigates
   route leaks.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Definition of Commonly Used Terms

   The definitions and semantics of Forwarding Commitment (FC) provided
   in [I-D.guo-sidrops-fc-profile] are applied here.

   *  *Route is ineligible*: The term has the same meaning as in
      [RFC4271], i.e., "route is ineligible to be installed in Loc-RIB
      and will be excluded from the next phase of route selection."

   *  *AS-path*: This term defines a sequence of ASes listed in the BGP
      UPDATE AS_PATH or AS4_PATH attribute.  In this document, the terms
      AS-path, AS_PATH, and AS4_PATH are interchangeably used.

   *  *TotallyValid*: This is one of the verification results of using
      FC objects to verify AS_PATH.  This means the FCs of each AS in
      AS_PATH are all with the 'originASes' field.

   *  *VFP*: Validated FC Payload (see Section 4).

4.  Forwarding Commitment (FC)

   Forwarding Commitment (FC) objects encapsulate the routing intent
   description of an Autonomous System (AS).  Unlike most RPKI-signed
   objects, FC objects possess a distinct design regarding verification
   results.  Since FC objects reference Route Origin Authorizations
   (ROAs) within their content, the verification outcomes for FC are
   categorized into four distinct states: TotallyValid, Valid, Invalid,
   and Unknown.

   It is RECOMMENDED that all routing intents be explicitly enumerated
   within a single FC object.  However, due to the inherent complexity
   of routing intents, providing a comprehensive list can be
   challenging.  Consequently, it is RECOMMENDED to include routing
   intents with the originASes field designated as 'NONE' when the
   issuer is unable to specify which routes will be propagated from
   previousASes to nexthopASes.  It may have a few of these
   routingIntents with the originASes field set as 'NONE'.

   In general, there exists a singular valid FC object corresponding to
   a specific asID.  However, in instances where multiple valid FC
   objects containing the same asID are present, the union of the
   resulting routingIntent members constitutes the comprehensive set of
   members.  This complete set, which may arise from either a single or
   multiple FCs, is locally maintained by a Relying Party (RP) or a
   compliant router.  Such an object is referred to as the Validated FC
   Payload (VFP) for the asID.

   Except for the empty originASes, there would also be empty
   previousASes and nexthopASes in a routing intent.  It is NOT
   RECOMMENDED to describe routing intent without nexthopASes as this
   does not help verify BGP AS_PATH.

   It is REQUIRED at least one routing intent description in an FC
   object.  Otherwise, the empty FC object means no routes can be
   transited or transformed from this asID.

5.  BGP AS_PATH Verification Algorithm Using FC

   FCs describe the local routing intents of an AS.  It can be used to
   verify the AS-path attribute in the BGP UPDATE message.

   Before the AS_PATH verification procedure, it can first perform
   prefix origin verification with ROA-ROV defined in Section 2 of
   [RFC6811] or SPL-ROV defined in Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-spl-verification].

   An eBGP router that conforms to this specification MUST implement FC-
   based AS_PATH verification procedures specified below.

   For each received BGP route:

   1.  Query all the FCs that are issued by the ASes that are in the AS-
       path attribute;

   2.  If all ASes on the AS-path have their FCs with the BGP AS-path
       conforming to all ASes routing intents and the route is also
       specified in the originASes field, the verification result is
       TotallyValid;

   3.  Else, if the originASes field is missing but all ASes on the AS-
       path have their FCs with the BGP AS-path conforming to all ASes
       routing intents, the verification result is Valid;

   4.  Else, if none of the AS on the AS path has its FC, the
       verification result is Unknown;

   5.  Else, if some of the ASes on the AS path have their FCs but
       others ASes do not have their FCs, the verification result is
       Invalid.

5.1.  Mitigation Policy

   The specific configuration of a mitigation policy based on AS_PATH
   verification using FC is at the discretion of the network operator.
   However, the following mitigation policy is highly recommended.

   *Invalid*: If the AS_PATH is determined to be Invalid, then the route
   SHOULD be considered ineligible for route selection and MUST be kept
   in the Adj-RIB-In for potential future re-evaluation (see [RFC9324]).

   *TotallyValid, Valid, or Unknown*: When a route is evaluated as
   Unknown (using FC-based AS_PATH verification), it SHOULD be treated
   at the same preference level as a route evaluated as Valid.  But
   TotallyValid has the highest priority in BGP route selection while
   Valid has a second priority.

6.  Operational Considerations

   Multiple valid Forwarding Commitment objects which contain the same
   asID could exist.  In such a case, the union of these objects forms
   the complete routing intent set of this AS.  For a given asID, it is
   RECOMMENDED that a CA maintains a single Forwarding Commitment.  If
   an AS holder publishes a Forwarding Commitment, then relying parties
   SHOULD assume that this object is complete for that issuer AS.

   If one AS receives a BGP UPDATE message with the issuer AS in the AS-
   path attribute which cannot match any routing intents of this issuer
   AS, it implies that there is an AS-path forgery in this message.
